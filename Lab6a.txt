Q1. Write a code block that uses an if-statement to test the contents of s, and if it is blank
(that is, of zero length), print "It's blank".

  A1.
if (s.length() == 0) cout << "It's blank" << endl;

Q2. Write a code block that uses an if-statement to test the contents of s, and if it equals your
name, print to the console "It's me!" (without the quote marks).

  A2.
if (s == "Aaron") cout << "It's me!" << endl;

Q3. Write a code block that uses an if-else-statement to test the contents of s, and if it equals
your name, print to the console "It's me!", otherwise print "It's somebody else.".

  A3.
if (s == "Aaron") cout << "It's me!" << endl;
  else cout << "It's somebody else." << endl;

Q4. Write a code block that uses an if-else-if-statement to test the contents of s, and if it
equals your name, print to the console "It's me!", but if it's your friend's name, print "It's
my friend.".

  A4. 
if (s == "Aaron") cout << "It's me!" << endl;
  else if (s == "Christina") cout << "It's my friend." << endl;

Q5. Write a code block that uses an if-else-if-else-statement to test the contents of s, and if
it equals your name, print to the console "It's me!", or if it's your friend's name, print "It's
my friend.", and if it is neither, print "It's somebody else.".

  A5. 
if (s == "Aaron") cout << "It's me!" << endl;
  else if (s == "Christina") cout << "It's my friend." << endl;
  else cout << "It's somebody else." << endl;

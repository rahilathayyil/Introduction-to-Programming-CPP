Q1. Write a single declaration statement that creates an array variable that can
store 10 int values, named a.

A1. int a[10];


Q2. Write a single declaration statement that creates an array variable that can
store 10 string values, named s.

A2. string s[10];


Q3. Write a single declaration statement that creates an array variable that can
store the names of the 12 months of the year, in a language of your choosing.
Name the array as you wish. Use curly-brace initialization to assign the names
of the months upon declaration. You may separate the statement into multiple
lines with line breaks after commas, as in the textbook examples.

A3. string month[] = {January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August,
September, October, November, December}


Q4. Write a single declaration statement that creates a dynamic array that can store
"n" int values, named scores. Assume that "n" is already declared as an int
variable and is assigned a non-negative value.

A4. int* scores = new int[n];


Q5. Write a code block with a for-loop to traverse the dynamic array named scores
of size "n", that prints to the console each value stored in the array, each
on a line by itself. Assume that the array and its size are already declared
and initialized to valid values.

A5. 
  for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
    {
    cout << scores[i] << endl;
    } // for

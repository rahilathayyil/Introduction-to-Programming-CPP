Introduction-to-Programming-CPP
===============================

Coursework from "Introduction to Programming in C++" course from Diablo Valley College.

This was the introductory course for C++, and assumed familiarity with core computing
concepts, but not with any programming paradigm.

This is where I wrote "Hello World" in C++. :)

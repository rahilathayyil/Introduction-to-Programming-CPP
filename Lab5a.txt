Q1. When prompted to enter your age, which is to be stored
as an integer, what happens if you enter (a) a value with
a decimal, such as 21.5?

A1.  a) Does the program accept the input? Yes
     a) Does the program terminate with a fatal error? No
     a) (If not) what does the output show? The decimal is
truncated, displaying "21".

... or (b) a text value, such as twenty-one?

     b) Does the program accept the input? No
     b) Does the program terminate with a fatal error? No
(at least, it does not display "fatal error," though it
does go bonkers).
     b) (If not) what does the output show? The program displays
the rest of the output statements, but all the remaining input
prompts run together on one line, the user is not given the
chance to input values, and the output for all 4 values is
unpredictable gobbledegook.

Q2. When prompted to enter your GPA, which is to be stored as a
floating point number, what happens if you enter (a) a value
without a decimal, such as 4?

A2.  a) Does the program accept the input? Yes
     a) Does the program terminate with a fatal error? No
     a) (If not) what does the output show? The output displays
the integer value.

... or (b) a text value, such as four?

             *** Identical to A1.b) ***

     b) Does the program accept the input? No
     b) Does the program terminate with a fatal error? No
(at least, it does not display "fatal error," though it
does go bonkers).
     b) (If not) what does the output show? The program displays
the rest of the output statements, but all the remaining input
prompts run together on one line, the user is not given the
chance to input values, and the output for all 4 values is
unpredictable gobbledegook.

Q3. When prompted to enter your name, which is to be stored as
any-character text, what happens if you enter (a) a decimal value,
such as 3.14?

A3.  a) Does the program accept the input? Y
     a) Does the program terminate with a fatal error? N
     a) (If not) what does the output show? "3.14". I suspect,
however, that this "3.14" is a string, and you cannot do math
with it. That's what we learned in Java, at least...

... or (b) a text value, such as George Washington?

     b) Does the program accept the input? Of course! This is what
it's designed to do!!!
     b) Does the program terminate with a fatal error? N
     b) (If not) what does the output show? The expected "string".

Q4. When prompted to enter your gender, which is to be
stored as single-character text, what happens if you enter
(a) a whole number, such as 4?

A4.  a) Does the program accept the input? Y
     a) Does the program terminate with a fatal error? N
     a) (If not) what does the output show? The input "4".

... or (b) a decimal value, such as 3.14?

     b) Does the program accept the input? Y
     b) Does the program terminate with a fatal error? N
     b) (If not) what does the output show? "3". The input
is truncated to the first character.

... or (c) a text value, such as male?

     c) Does the program accept the input? Y
     c) Does the program terminate with a fatal error? N
     c) (If not) what does the output show? "m". The input
is truncated to the first character.

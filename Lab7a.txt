Q1. Write a code block that uses a for-loop to print to the console your name
10 times, once per line.

A1.
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
  {
  cout << "Aaron Melocik" << endl;
  } // for



Q2. Write a code block that uses a for-loop to print this space-separated sequence:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

A2. 
for (i=0; 1<8; i++)
  {
  cout << i << " ";
  } //for



Q3. Write a code block that uses a for-loop to print this space-separated sequence:
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

A3. 
for (i=11; i<21; i++)
  {
  cout << i << " ";
  } //for.
    // I wrote / executed this program modifying the "bounce2" code; good to know
    // that "i++" always increases by "1."
    // I worried that it might increase the count by a number related to the value of int i. :)



Q4. Write a code block that uses a for-loop to print this space-separated sequence:
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

A4. 
for (i=10; i>=0; i--)
  {
  cout << i << " ";
  } // for
    // same as above - wrote and executed to confirm "i--" syntax. It works. :)


Q5. Write a code block that uses nested for-loops (and no if-statements or switch-statements)
to produce this sequence of 4 lines of asterisks (that is, the char value '*'):
*
**
***
****

A5. 
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) 
{ 
  for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) 
    {
    cout << '*'; 
    }
  cout << endl; 
} // for 


Q6. Mark up this code block with TWO statements, to count the number of cycles executed in
the event-controlled loop:
  while (...)
  {
    ...
  }
The ... sequences represent unspecified code. Don't print the result -- just count.

A6. 
while (cycles < x)
  {
  cycles = cycles + 1
  } // while


Q7. Write the logical opposite of this if-statement, applying DeMorgan's Theorem: if (a == 1 || a == 2) .

A7. 
if ( a !=1 && a != 2)
